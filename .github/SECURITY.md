# Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you discovered a security vulnerability, please report it privately so we can fix it before public disclosure.

Contact: open a private issue and label it `security`, or email a maintainer (see contact in `Cargo.toml` / `package.json`).

Include:
- Short description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Affected components/versions
- Any PoC or logs

We will aim to respond within 72 hours and coordinate fixes and disclosure.
